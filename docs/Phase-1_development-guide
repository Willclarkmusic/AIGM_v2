2. **Navigate to your development folder**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\your-dev-folder
   ```
3. **Ensure WSL2 is working**
   ```powershell
   wsl --version
   # Should show WSL version 2.x.x
   ```

## Phase 0: Project Setup with Claude Code

### Step 3: Start Claude Code Session

**Time Required: 2 hours**

1. **Open Claude Code in your terminal**
2. **Copy and paste this EXACT prompt:**

```
You are the primary Claude Code instance for the AIGM chat application project.

CRITICAL SETUP CONTEXT:
- OS: Windows 11 with WSL2
- Terminal: You're running in WSL2 through PowerShell so use PS and venv mostly.  Only use WSL if you absolutely have to
- Python: Use python -m venv venv for virtual environments
- File paths: Use Linux-style paths (/)
- Working directory: I want to create the project in the current directory

REQUIRED READING:
I have complete project documentation ready. The key files you MUST understand first:
1. claude.md - Project rules and guidelines
2. architecture.md - Technical architecture and database schema
3. testing-guide.md - TDD methodology with priority testing order

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Building AIGM - a modern messaging platform with:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind + TipTap + Supabase SDK
- Backend: FastAPI + Python + Supabase + Cloudflare R2
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase (cloud)
- Real-time: Supabase Realtime WebSockets

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASKS:
1. Create the complete project structure
2. Set up frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)
3. Set up backend (FastAPI + Python virtual environment)
4. Create all environment files with proper templates
5. Set up Docker development environment
6. Initialize git repository with proper .gitignore

CRITICAL FOCUS:
This is Phase 0 - infrastructure setup only. Create the complete foundation but do NOT implement features yet. Focus on:
- Proper project structure
- All dependencies installed correctly
- Environment configuration ready
- Development server setup working
- Git repository initialized

START WITH:
1. Ask me to confirm the current working directory
2. Create the project structure
3. Set up both frontend and backend with all dependencies
4. Create environment file templates
5. Set up Docker development environment
6. Initialize git and create initial commit

Be methodical and ask for confirmation before major steps. Ensure everything is properly set up before moving to the next phase.
```

3. **Follow Claude Code's instructions exactly**
4. **When it asks for confirmation, provide:**
   - Current directory: Your chosen development folder
   - Supabase credentials from Step 1
   - Cloudflare credentials from Step 1
   - OAuth credentials from Step 1

### Step 4: Verify Setup

**Time Required: 15 minutes**

After Claude Code completes the setup, verify everything works:

1. **Check project structure:**

   ```bash
   ls -la aigm-chat/
   # Should show: frontend/, backend/, docs/, tests/, docker-compose.yml, etc.
   ```

2. **Test frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd aigm-chat/frontend
   npm run dev
   # Should start on http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Test backend:**

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   # Should start on http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. **If anything fails, ask Claude Code to fix it before proceeding**

## Phase 0.5: Infrastructure Testing (CRITICAL)

### Step 5: Start New Claude Code Session for Testing

**Time Required: 3-4 hours**

1. **Start fresh Claude Code session**
2. **Use this EXACT prompt:**

```
You are continuing the AIGM chat application development. The project structure has been created and now we need to implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) for the core infrastructure.

CURRENT STATUS:
- Project structure created in ./aigm-chat/
- Frontend and backend basic setup complete
- Environment files configured
- Ready to implement TDD approach

CRITICAL PHASE 0.5 OBJECTIVES:
This phase is about infrastructure testing - we MUST get the foundation bulletproof before building features.

PRIORITY ORDER (MUST DO IN THIS EXACT ORDER):
1. User Search API Tests (PRIORITY #1 - EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON THIS)
2. Friend Request Workflow Tests
3. Real-time Message Delivery Tests
4. Database Schema Setup & Seed Data
5. Supabase Integration Tests

TDD METHODOLOGY:
1. RED: Write comprehensive failing tests first
2. GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. REFACTOR: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. NO FEATURES WITHOUT TESTS

IMMEDIATE TASKS:
1. Set up Supabase database schema from architecture.md
2. Create seed data (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Eve users)
3. Implement User Search API with ALL tests from testing-guide.md
4. Implement Friend Request system with tests
5. Set up real-time WebSocket foundation with tests

CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- User search must find 'alice' when typing 'ali' in <500ms
- All user search edge cases covered (blocking, pagination, etc.)
- Friend request workflow bulletproof
- Real-time message delivery working
- All tests passing before moving to Phase 1

START BY:
1. Navigate to the aigm-chat directory
2. Set up Supabase database schema
3. Create comprehensive user search tests
4. Implement user search API to pass tests

Remember: Everything depends on user search working perfectly. If users can't find each other, they can't become friends, and the app is useless.
```

3. **Let Claude Code work through each step methodically**
4. **Pay special attention to:**
   - All user search tests passing
   - Friend request workflow tests passing
   - Real-time WebSocket tests passing

### Step 6: Critical Validation Point

**Time Required: 30 minutes**

Before proceeding, these MUST be working:

1. **Run user search tests:**

   ```bash
   cd aigm-chat/backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   pytest tests/test_user_search.py -v
   # ALL TESTS MUST PASS
   ```

2. **Run friend workflow tests:**

   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_friend_workflow.py -v
   # ALL TESTS MUST PASS
   ```

3. **Test API manually:**

   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8000/api/users/search?q=ali"
   # Should return Alice user in <500ms
   ```

4. **If ANY test fails, do NOT proceed. Fix with Claude Code first.**
